Create 2 arrays, 'given' and 'found'
'given' will be the encrypted input.
'found' will be compared to it, and the difference between the two will be counted.
'found' will be the array constructed by encrypting it with a key.

There are 26 possible keys for this cipher. Because we don't have the key,
we will try all 26 possible keys. The solution will be the key that results in the
'found' array that is the closest to the 'given' array of the 26 tested keys.
